Developed a food ordering web application leveraging React.js and Swiggy's API.
The app features a user-friendly interface built with HTML5, CSS3, and Tailwind CSS.
Users can browse top restaurant chains, explore "About Us" and "Contact" sections, and seamlessly manage their carts through an interactive cart page.
This project demonstrates my proficiency in front-end development, API integration, and user experience design.
